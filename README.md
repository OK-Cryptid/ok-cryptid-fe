## Abstract

Ok Cryptid is here to help you have your very own cryptid encounter! Weâ€™ll help you identify the trails where you are  mostly likely to cross paths with your favorite cryptid!

## Project Goals

- Gain competency with GraphiQL
- Create a multi-page UX using Router V6
- Deploy to Heroku
- Learn and implement Cypress stubbing for GraphiQL

## Project Specs

View the spec for this project

**Homepage:**

The user can select see and select any cryptid that peeks their interests.

**View a single cryptid's details page:**

When a cryptid is selected, the user is directed to a page with information about that specific cryptid. If the user would like to go a step furture, they can click the 'sightings of *' button to where that cryptid has been spotted.

**All Sightings page:**

From the all sightings page, a user can filter their search by cryptid or location with a state input search. If a cryptid has been seen in that location, the sighting will be rendered, if the location does not have any sightings the user is prompted to try another search.

**Single Sighting page:**

When a sighting is selected, they are taken to that specific sighting which the provides links to hiking trails near by. When the link is clicked a new tab opens with an external AllTrails link.

**Error handling:**

If an error occurs when trying to access the app, the user is shown an error modal letting them know what went wrong.


## Challenges

- The OK Cryptid app was built in the short time span of 15 days.
- This was our team's first time implementing GraphiQL into a project. Adding this to our project required hours of research and bug solving.
- Negotiating our api contract was difficult, simply because we didn't know how GQL worked at first.


## Future Iterations

- Add back buttons to the single cryptid and single sighting page
- Create login functionality to allow users to keep track of their trails and sightings
- Allow a user to add sightings of their own to share with others
- Create trails pages within the app instead of navigating to a new window
- Add fun animations for error modal

## Install and Setup

To run this app locally:

1. fork this repository
2. run ```git clone git clone git@github.com:OK-Cryptid/ok-cryptid-fe.git``` in your command line
3. Run ```cd rancidtomatillos``` to navigate into the repository
4. Run ```npm install```
5. Run ```npm start```
6. Visit ```http://localhost:3000/``` in your browser to view the Rancid Tomatillos app!
7. Open a second terminal tab and run ```npm run cypress``` (while localhost:3000 is still running) to access the cypress testing for this app

## api

For this project, we access data from a GraphiQl API created by our backend team.
